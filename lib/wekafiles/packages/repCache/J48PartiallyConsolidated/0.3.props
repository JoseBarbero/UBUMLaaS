# Description (required)
Description=Class for generating a Partially Consolidated Tree-Bagging (PCTBagging) multiple classifier. Allows building a classifier between a single consolidated tree (100%), based on J48Consolidated, and a bagging (0%), according to the given consolidation percent. First, a partially consolidated tree is built based on a set of samples, and then, a standard J48 decision tree is developed from the leaves of the tree related to each sample, as Bagging does.
