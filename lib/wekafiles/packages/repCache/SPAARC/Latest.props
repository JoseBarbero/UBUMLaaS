Description=Class implementing decision tree algorithm SPAARC, using split-point sampling and node-attribute subsampling. Uses an altered version of SimpleCart. SPAARC builds trees with equivalent classification accuracy to SimpleCart, but does so with up to 69% greater speed. For more information, see: Darren Yates, Md Zahidul Islam, Junbin Gao (2018). SPAARC: A Fast Decision Tree Algorithm (AusDM 2018). Presented at the 2018 Australasian Data Mining conference (AusDM 2018) at Bathurst, NSW on 28-30 November 2018.
