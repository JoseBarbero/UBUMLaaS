Description=Makes the simple TigerJython development environment for Jython written by Tobias Kohn, including its interactive console, available via the Tools menu in WEKA's GUIChooser. Can be used to write Jython programs that work with WEKA objects. Also enables you to interactively experiment with WEKA.

Changes=Modified Tiger Jython .jar file by replacing the Scala code files in this .jar file with those from Scala 2.11.12, to obtain Java 11 compatibility; expanded scala-library.jar, scala-swing_2.11-1.0.2.jar, and scala-actors-2.11.0.jar for this.
