Description=Implements StackingC (more efficient version of stacking). For more information, see A.K. Seewald: How to Make Stacking Better and Faster While Also Taking Care of an Unknown Weakness. In: Nineteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, 554-561, 2002. Note: requires meta classifier to be a numeric prediction scheme.

Changes=Now supports multi-threading. Now also supports efficient batch prediction if base learners or meta learner provide this. No longer inherits from Stacking (to maintain backwards compatibility).
