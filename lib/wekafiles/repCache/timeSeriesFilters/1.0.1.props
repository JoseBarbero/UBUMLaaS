# Description (required)
Description=Provides a set of filters for time series. Currently contains PAA and SAX transformation filters and a filter that converts symbolic time series to string attribute values. The time series for these filters need to be given as values of a relation-valued attribute in the ARFF file. For example data in ARFF format, check the data directory of this package. There is also a filter, FlatToRelational, which can convert time series of fixed length given in a flat file into relational format for further processing.

Changes=Fixed bug where filtering did not work when the relation name of the nested relation did not match the name of the relation-valued attribute. Also implemented some efficiency improvements. Added FlatToRelational.
