    of different classes there are.
    If a sample results in a wrong classification after being classified
    with k-NN, that sample is removed from the TS, only if the sample to be
    removed is not from the original dataset.

    ones added by self-training.

    without deleting the original samples), False if it must perform ENN
    by Wilson guidelines.
