    Implementation of The Condensed Nearest Neighbor Rule

    The first sample of each class is placed in *store*. Thus we only have
    one the second sample classification will be trivial. When a sample is
    classified correctly it is places in *handbag*, otherwise it is placed
    inside *store*. This procedure will be repeated until the nth sample is
    being classified, whether it was correctly or not.
    Once the first loop is finished, it continues looping through *handbag*
    until termination, what will happen if either of these two cases occurs:
    - All the samples have been added to *store*, which means *handbag* is
    empty.
    - One complete pass has been made through *handbag* and none samples
    where transferred to *store*. The following passes will end up with the
    same result as the underlying decision surface has not been changed.
