    Implementation of The Reduced Nearest Neighbor

    RNN is an extension of CNN. Firstly CNN will be executed in order to have
    S-CCN. It will perform iterative sample removal from S, and reclasificate
    all T, in hopes that there is no sample inside T classified incorrectly,
    in case there is at least one, the sample removed will be added again to S.

    :param X: dataset with scikit-learn structure.
    :return: the input dataset with the remaining samples.
